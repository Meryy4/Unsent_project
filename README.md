##  About

**Unsent** is a therapeutic web application designed to help you process unspoken emotions. Write the words you can't say, let them rest, and watch yourself heal. The app provides a safe, private space to express feelings that may never be sent — letters to loved ones, thoughts about the past, or emotions you're still working through.

##  Features

###  Write (Sanctuary)
- Express your deepest feelings in a safe, judgment-free space
- Address messages to anyone (optional) — past relationships, lost loved ones, or yourself
- **AI-powered emotion analysis** detects the dominant emotion and intensity of your writing
- Receive personalized comfort messages based on your emotional state
- Choose to **keep** your entry for later reflection or **release** it

###  Reflect
- Revisit past entries after they've had time to "incubate"
- Track how your emotions have evolved over time
- Compare your feelings **then vs. now**
- Receive AI-generated **growth insights** celebrating your emotional journey
- Beautiful side-by-side visualization of your emotional progress

###  Emotion Journey
- Visual dashboard tracking all your emotional patterns
- Emotion frequency bars with intensity averages
- Beautiful emotion symbols for 12 different emotions:
  - ✨ Joy | 〰 Grief | ⚡ Anger | ♡ Love
  - ☀ Hope | ◐ Fear | ◯ Peace | ⋯ Longing
  - ◈ Regret | ❋ Gratitude | ≋ Anxiety | ◡ Relief

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
